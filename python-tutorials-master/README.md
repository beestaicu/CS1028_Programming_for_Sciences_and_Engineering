# CS1028 Python tutorials
This repository contains solutions to some of the tutorial questions
for CS1028 course at the University of Aberdeen, fall 2019/20.
The tutorial questions have been prepared by the lecturers, dr Robert Duncan and dr Daniel Vogel.

It also provides code samples with extensive explanations.
These concern some of the basic concepts in Python and programming in general.
They are meant to address some of the most frequently occurring issues.

## Using the repository
Producing well-described solutions takes time.
The most difficult questions will be prioritised.

You are encouraged to submit requests for solutions to specific questions
using the issue tracker (https://github.com/animaviridis/python-tutorials/issues).
The best way to do it is to create an issue with label `enhancement`.
Questions concerning existing solutions can be given the `question` or `help needed` label, etc.

Naturally, you can also send an e-mail to the tutors or just approach them during the classes.

### Contributing
If you feel like helping develop this repository, you are welcome to submit your own solutions
(or general code samples). The best way to do so is to use the 
[pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) tool.

When preparing your submission, bear in mind the following:
- stick to the existing repository structure (arrange solutions by week, 
include question numbers in the file names etc.);
- put comments throughout your code - more than you may think is needed;
the purpose of this repository is to help others learn coding, and understanding
the reasoning behind a script is one of the crucial parts of the process.
